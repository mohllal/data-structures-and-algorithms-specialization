# To force the given implementation of the quick sort algorithm to efficiently process sequences with few unique elements.
# The goal of this task is to replace a 2-way partition with a 3-way partition. 
# That is, the new partition procedure should partition the array into three parts: < ùë• part, = ùë• part, and > ùë• part.
